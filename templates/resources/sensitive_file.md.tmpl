# {{.Name}} ({{.Type}})

{{ .Description | trimspace }}

The arguments accepted by this resource are marked as
[sensitive](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/sensitive-variables).

~> **Note about resource behaviour**
When working with local files, Terraform will detect the resource
as having been deleted each time a configuration is applied on a new machine
where the file is not present and will generate a diff to re-create it. This
may cause "noise" in diffs in environments where configurations are routinely
applied by many different users or within automation systems.

~> **Note about file content**
File content must be specified with _exactly_ one of the arguments `content`,
`content_base64`, or `source`.
